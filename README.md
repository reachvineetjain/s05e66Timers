# s05e66Timers
Final Commit of repo Timers

Code based on Rob Percival's lesson on Timers
There are 2 ways to handle timers
One is via the Handler & Runnable class which counts up 
and the other is the CountDownTimer class which count downs to 0

Both the codes are in the MainActivity.java. No UI code for this
